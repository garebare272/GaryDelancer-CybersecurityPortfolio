# Playwright Automated Job Applier

## 📜 Overview
This project automates the “Easy Apply” workflow on LinkedIn using Playwright. It streamlines repetitive job‑application steps so I can target more openings in less time.

## 🛠️ Role & Tools
- **Role:** Programmer, College Graduate  
- **Tools:** Playwright, Python, VS Code, OpenAI

## 🎯 Objective
Many positions align with my cybersecurity and IT career goals, but applying individually is time‑consuming. This script automates the process so I can focus on tailoring follow‑ups and interview prep.

## ✅ Key Deliverables
- Headless Python script that logs in, filters jobs, and submits applications
- Configurable job‑level and keyword filters for precise targeting
- Re‑usable Playwright framework with clear setup instructions

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
Building this solution sharpened my browser‑automation skills, session‑management tactics, and understanding of LinkedIn’s DOM structure. It also reinforced ethical automation practices, including rate‑limiting and respectful platform use.
