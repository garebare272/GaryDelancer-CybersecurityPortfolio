# Playwright Automated Job Applier

## 📜 Overview
This project automates the “Easy Apply” workflow on LinkedIn using Playwright. It streamlines repetitive job‑application steps so I can target more openings in less time.

- Configurable job‑level and keyword filters for precise targeting
- Re‑usable Playwright framework with clear setup instructions
