Hi, Iâ€™m Gary Delancer â€” a cybersecurity professional with a ðŸŽ“ Masterâ€™s in Cybersecurity Management from Nova Southeastern University and hands-on experience at Apple as a Technical Specialist. I created this GitHub portfolio to showcase my academic, technical, and professional projects across key domains such as policy development, incident response, network configuration, database security, and SOC operations.

Iâ€™m passionate about securing systems, solving problems with precision, and continuously growing in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. I'm open to a wide range of opportunities across IT, cybersecurity, and information security, including entry-level analyst roles, infrastructure security, endpoint protection, ethical hacking, or project support. I thrive in environments where I can learn from others, adapt quickly, and take initiative.

This portfolio is a living collection of my work â€” I plan to continuously expand it with new projects, including ethical hacking labs, advanced security assessments, and applied research in cybersecurity best practices. My goal is to contribute to a team that values both curiosity and accountability, and to grow into a versatile, high-impact security professional.
